# RFID_Attendance_measuring_system_project
Manual attendance tracking systems are prone to inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and time-consuming processes, leading to administrative burdens and potential data inconsistencies. The existing methods often involve manual data entry, which is susceptible to errors and can result in discrepancies in attendance records. Additionally, traditional systems lack real-time monitoring capabilities, making it challenging for administrators to promptly address attendance-related issues. 
To address these challenges, the project aims to develop an RFID-based attendance system using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The system seeks to automate the process of recording attendance by leveraging RFID technology for individual identification. By integrating RFID reader modules with the Raspberry Pi Pico, the system will enable seamless scanning and capture of RFID tag information, eliminating the need for manual data entry and reducing the risk of errors.
